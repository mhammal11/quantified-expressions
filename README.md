This repository holds the source code, documentation and testing efforts for our **Quantified Expressions** project. 

The purpose of this project is to extend the P0 language to support quantified expressions including array and set comprehension as well as extend the code generator by generating a loop for each quantified expression expression, as seen in other common programming languages.
